 I wrote another 5 C programs, and I will explain them in detail as follows.

(1) binary_search.c
In this program, both for loops and while loop are used.

function "assign" just assigns an arithmetic sequence to the array a[low]...a[high]
function "binary_search" tries to find "value" in the array a[low]...a[high]
function "foo" will call the function "binary_search".

I think it is a correct program, while Sniper reported "error".

(2) factorial.c
In this program, recursive function call appears.

function "fac" just calculates the factorial of n, and returns the value.

I think it is a simple and correct program, but Sniper says something like below

> -- Error-inducing Input:
> (= x 5)
> SNIPER was unable to localize root causes.

(3) Fibonacci.c
function "Fib" calculates the value of Fibonacci[n] and returns it

Sniper says "error" while I think the program should have worked well.

(4) insertion_sort.c(the code is adapted from the book "Introduction to algorithms")
In this program, several functions appears.
function "assign" assigns arbitrary value to the a[0]...a[len - 1]
function "insertion_sort" sorts the array a[0]...a[len - 1] using insertion sort
function "check" checks whether the array a[0]...a[len - 1] is sorted

Though a little bit complicated, I think the program is correct.
Sniper also says "error" but no more information is displayed.

(5) merge_sort.c(the code is adapted from the book "Introduction to algorithms")
This program is just like "insertion_sort.c" but it sorts the array using merge sort.
When we use merge sort, recursive function call will appear.
Sniper says "error" to this program, too.
