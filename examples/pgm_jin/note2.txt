There is also a book [1] in the attachment which describes the ideas and algorithms behind these programs.

I will give a short description as follows.
(1) sum.c
    In this program, foo calculates the sum of an array by "divide and conquer" strategy.
    In fact, this program has nothing to with numerical computing.

(2) square_root.c
    In this program, foo calculates an approximate value of the square root of a given integer. Since we can only use number of "int" type,
    so all the results are presented with fraction.

(3) derivative.c
    In this program, foo calculates the value of a derivative function at x. The results are also presented with fraction.

(4) calculate_area.c
    In this program, foo calculates the approximate value of a specified region. The results are presented with fraction.

(5) another_calculate.c
    In this program, foo calculates the approximate value of a specified region but by another method.
    The results are presented with fraction.
